The local name of the hill was Yenugu Mallama Konda after a legend of a saintly old woman named Mallamma who lived at the top of the hill and was fed by elephants (yenugulu). W.D. Horsley, a British collector, 
                built his home around 1870 after whom it is named. 
                In contrast to the dry and hot surrounding, this area is well vegetated with cooler climate.

                Horsley Hills is a series of hills in Andhra Pradesh in Madanapalle Taluka of Annamayya district and is about 9 miles from Madanapalle town. n 1863, WH Horsley,
                the British Collector of Kadapa built a forest resthouse here to escape the heat of the plains. 
                Subsequently, various other bungalows were added, which are still extant. In the southern dry deciduous forests here, the British planted exotic species such as mahogany, coffee, eucalyptus and silver oak. 
                The area hosts a variety of wildlife such as wild boars, bears, monkeys, jungle fowls and snakes.</p>

            <h3 class="history-heading2">Environmental Centre</h3>
            <p class="history-para">Built around Horsley’s forest resthouse, the Environmental Centre is basically a park. At its entrance is a zoo with a modest assortment of animals such as deer, peacocks, rabbits and crocodiles. Further ahead, lies the resthouse built by Horsley. 
                To its south is a viewpoint from where you can see the urban sprawl of Madanapalle in the distance. 
                A mammoth 150-year-old eucalyptus tree known as Kalyani stands proudly next to the resthouse. 
                A trail behind the resthouse takes you to a small pavilion with a statue of Krishna. 
                This is the highest point on the hill. To the north is the Nature Study Centre, which is usually closed. 
                Manasa Sarovar, the only freshwater source atop the hills, is next to it.
            </p>

            <h3 class="history-heading2">Famous Things</h3>
            <p class="history-para">It is one of the most popular places to visit in Horsley Hills. 
                It is located at the highest summit of Horsley hills and offers a spectacular view of valleys, hillocks, and dense forests. The view of the endless expanse, dotted by hills and forests, is in itself worth the trip to the hill station.</p>
